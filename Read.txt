The project is a simple to-do list application implemented in PHP. Here's a brief summary:

Registration (register.php):

Users can create an account by providing their username, email, and password.
The form data is validated on the server-side to ensure the required fields are filled and the email is in a valid format.
Upon successful registration, the user's information is stored in the database for future login.
Login (login.php):

Registered users can log in using their email and password.
The login credentials are verified against the database records.
Upon successful login, the user is redirected to the tasks page.
Tasks Page (tasks.php):

After logging in, users can view their to-do list.
Users can add new tasks by entering a task description in the input field and clicking the "Add Task" button.
The newly added tasks are stored in the database and displayed on the page.
Users can mark tasks as completed or delete them.
The task list is dynamically updated without the need for page refresh.
The project uses PHP for server-side processing, MySQL for the database, and HTML/CSS for the user interface. It demonstrates basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing a to-do list.
